# weather-data
A Python script to pull weather data from wunderground.com using a free API

You will need to input your own API key. You can get a free one from wunderground here: https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/

You will also need to add your own weather station or stations. This is designed to pull information from public weather stations, not your personal weather station.

Lastly, you will need to edit the dates of the time period you want to pull data from. Please note that the free API limits you to 10 calls per minute, so you're essentially limited to pulling 10 days of data per minute.
